# Astro Storybook

The goal of this project is to enable support for Astro components in Storybook.

This repository is an experimental project and is not a fully functional Storybook addon. It is not ready for production use.

## Known issues

- [ ] UI components are not hydrated when using `client` directives.
- [ ] Currently, only React integration is supported, and it is hardcoded.
- [ ] Astro components with CSS throw errors.
- [ ] Unhandled rejection errors occur sometimes when rendering Astro components.

## Setup instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn storybook`

**Any help is highly appreciated!**
